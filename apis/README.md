# chat_backend
A simple Chat Service Backend

The project is about developing a chat server system in node.js, enabling users to join chat rooms,
send/receive messages and access chat history.

### Mandatory:
- User authentication with basic username/password login. The credentials can be hardcoded.
- Creation of a single chat room upon server startup. 
- Persistent storage of chat messages in a Database.
- Sending and receiving messages in the chat room. The client must be able to fetch the room messages
- RESTful endpoints for message sending, and message retrieval.
- Unit testing

### Bonus:
- WebSocket support for real-time chat communication instead of REST API.
- Deletion of messages by clients.
- CI/CD skeleton
- Server scalability
